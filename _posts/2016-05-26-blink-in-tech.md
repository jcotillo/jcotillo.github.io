Blink was the first book i read that didn't involve programming since I completed coding bootcamp last spring. It captivated me from beginning to end, and even though I don't have a psychology background its narrative was flowing and easy to understand. Intersectionality is everywhere, so here the three points that I found most valuable, from the perspective of a minority developer.


## Knowledge doesn't always mean that you will make the right decision

As a junior developer, I am used to being lost in a debate between more senior developers. Their knowledge allows them to consider factors and scenarios that I would never fathom. They suggest and apply solutions that seemed to be far beyond my level. During scrum meetings, us junior developers stay quiet and listen to the masters debate what is the best technical solution to the problem at hand. In Blink, Gladwell makes an arguement that knowledge doesn't equate good decision making. He references historical points like the USA's lack of understanding of Japan's intentions even though they had access to all of their military's correspondence and reports. They were oversaturated with information and it didn't allowed them to see the pattern. Sometimes, good decisions can be made with a smaller knowledge base. One doesn't have to be a senior developer to understand a problem and propose an optimal solution.

## We are all guilty of unconscious bias -- but what are we going to do about it?

In Blink, Gladwell presents small doses of experiments so that the reader may try to visualize their own prejudice. Hard to admit that I, a brown woman, fall into the same reactionary stereotypes that I so much despised. He also brings up another industry who had a pipeline problem with minorities -- classical music. 25 years ago, less than 5% of orchestra players were women. The judges who were overseeing audiences swore that women who would audition were simply not as qualified. This was proven wrong once they began implementing blind auditions where all traces of race, age, and gender of the candidate were concealed. Now, women make up about 50% of major symphonies in the US. How could we see the same in the technology field? Would it be possible to conduct an entire interview with an unanonymous candidate? I believe so. There are already some initiatives out there like [Blendoor](http://blendoor.com/) striving to make the hiring process more fair but I think we can go a step further. It's not only the first step -- getting the candiate in the door -- but there can also be bias once they are in the interview itself. I believe this process can also be blinded as well. We can use tools like slack and google docs to conduct coding challenges and keep the candidate's characteristics unanonymous. Changes in practice like this would actually mean more diversity in technology.

## Don't blame the decision makers

This one was a hard one for me to swallow at first. Gladwell isn't shy to bring up sensitive topics like police brutality against minority or minors in Blink. How could I blame the cops for their wrong doing? Gladwell disinsects every thought, every feeling second by second of high intensity confrontations between cops and minorities. Most notably, he speaks of the case of Amadou Diallo, who was an innocent immigrant man shot 41 times by four cops in the Bronx, NY. He walks the readers through the cops' reactions and thoughts as they see a man outside his house and began constructing an incriminating story to justify his presence. They began to see only what supports this story and this drives them to murder an innocent man. Gladwell points out that this faulty way of decision making is similar to how people with Autism approach situations. Under high stress, people cannot read intentions on people's faces and therefore draw understanding from their surroundings. This drove me to understand that as much as I want to consider them evil creatures, they are reacting in a very human way. When it comes to people, one must not allow their own biases to cloud their decision making -- but this is a conscious effort we must all practice.
