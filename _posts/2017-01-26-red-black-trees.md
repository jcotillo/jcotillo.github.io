The difficulty of red-black trees is remembering what elements you are dealing with and how are they changing. Easier to visualize, hard to code (despite what the Professor might say). But why do we go through all of the trouble? 2-3 trees and red-black trees guarantee a 0(C log N)...for EVERY operation. The fastest symbol table implementation.
