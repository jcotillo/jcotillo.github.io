Yesterday night I went to my first tech event in Peru. I had stumbled upon WIT sometime last year and gotten really excited about its existence in my country. Women developers are scarce everywhere and I was happy to see Peru techies doing something about it. The meetup was hosted by a co-working space named Starscamp and had a line-up of different presentations and pitches. It had an open platform that didn't feel disorganized or unstructured. Topics ranged from a digital marketing non-profit platform to "what is devOps?" and "Why you use linux". It was friendly to all ranges of experience and in fact many students from Laboratoria (a great women-only coding bootcamp based in Lima) were present.

It was a small and homey environment packed with information. As an American developer, it gave me a glimpse of the tech scene in Peru. It was competitive, informative and inspiring. The organizers of WIT do a great job of making you feel welcome whatever your level is. I personally struggle with professional Spanish and have never talked about APIs, data structures, design pattern, etc in my native tongue before. The team didn't judge me and gave me many interesting points to consider as I continue to grow as a developer.
