Graphs can represent any sort of relationship between objects. Out of the all data structures, graphs are so vague that it allows for conceptualization of the core elements.

 **vertex** the bits of information this graph will tie together. Can have a key and payload, which represents additional information of the object.

 **edge** the line between each vertex. An edge connects two vertices to show a relationship. May be one-way direction, called a diagraph -- directed graph, or two ways.

 **weight** an optional cost from one vertex to another.

 **path** a sequence of vertices that are connected by edges.

 **cycle** a directed graph that starts and ends at the same vertex. A graph with no cycle is "acyclic" and "DAG" is a directed acyclic graph.
