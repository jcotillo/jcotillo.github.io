Peruvian queer gal trying to figure out this whole internet world. I have a B.A. in economics & international relations from Boston University, but like many others I didn't like the finance world so I went to [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/en) March 2015. Currently working at [Kipu Systems](http://kipusystems.com/) where I get to work with Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Heroku, and the usuals.
